League of Legends is a MOBA, which is an acronym for multiplayer online battle arena. In a MOBA, there are two teams and you can play as a character on one of them. You can go into respective parts of the map where you will face off against other players. Your main goal is to siege and eventually destroy the enemy base commonly reffered to as the nexus. Throughout the game you can acquire objectives that will give your team more gold and buffs. You and your team will use gold in order to purchase items that will allow you to become stronger. With this newfound power, you will be able to take down the towers that are blocking the way to the enemy nexus. Destroying the enemy nexus will grant you victory and reward you with points, that you can use to purchase virtual items.";
