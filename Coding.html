        <div id="html"><h2 id="title">HTML</h2>
        <hi id="bold">Background:</hi><hi> HTML is an acronym that stands for Hypertext Markup Language.
        HTML is used as a coding language for text files to change font, color, and other effects on websites. 
        HTML is able to incorporate multiple objects onto a webpage but no real way to deal with the actual organization of the objects
        HTML is used for the basic design of websites. HTML originated from a contractor of CERN, that wanted a text software for CERN researchers to use and share documents
        HTML is written as a markup language. The current version of HTML that we are using today is HTML5. 
        HTML didn't start out as HTML5, programmers have been updating HTML constantly and releasing new versions of the language.
        HTML is used by browsers to interpret the content of the page, not represent the actual HTML tags and coding behind it.
        HTML is able to embed scripts from a language called Javascript which affect the behavior of HTML webpages.

        <div id="css"><h2 id="title">CSS</h2>
        <hi id="bold">Background:</hi><hi> CSS is an acronym that stands for Cascading Style Sheet.
        CSS is used as a coding language for web pages to keep information in certain places and controls most of a sites' aesthetics only for sites written in a markup language.
        CSS is most often used for sites written in HTML and XHTML. CSS is mainly used from separating content from presentation.
        CSS was written by W3C which is the main organization responsible for designing World Wide Web.
        The main purpose of CSS was to allow the separation of documents and presentation on a web page. 
        CSS is written to compliment web pages written in markup languages. 
        CSS controls most of the visual aspects and ordering of objects on a web page.
        CSS has been updated to bring us the latest version, CSS 4, but each variation of CSS is used to fit the needs of which piece of technology it will be used in.
        CSS uses simplified words to depict various style properties.

        <hi id="k"><li>HTML and CSS were designed to collaborate with each other for webpage designs </li> <li>Both languages are for designing web pages</li>
        <li>CSS fixed a lot of problems that HTML had with the placement of objects in a webpage.</li>
        <li>HTML and CSS were made by the same organization</li>
        <li>HTML is used for the primary makeup of a webpage, while CSS is able to go the extra mile to make that website just a bit more neat and colorful</li>
        <li>HTML is used more than CSS, but most well done HTML written webpages have CSS in it as well.</li>
        <li>The maker of CSS had worked with the maker of HTML before.</li>
        <div id="allah"><h1 id="k">What are tags?</h1>
        <hi id="k">A tag is a header that encloses text in coding.
        These are a few examples of tags. 
        You write tags by enclosing them within the greater than and less than signs, and have the correct abbreviation inside it.
