        <hi>Background: HTML is an acronym that stands for Hypertext Markup Language.
        HTML is used as a coding language for text files to change font, color, and other effects on websites. 
        HTML is able to incorporate multiple objects onto a webpage but no real way to deal with the actual organization of the objects
        HTML is used for the basic design of websites. HTML originated from a contractor of CERN, that wanted a text software for CERN researchers to use and share documents
        HTML is written as a markup language.

        <hi>Background: CSS is an acronym that stands for Cascading Style Sheet.
        CSS is used as a coding language for web pages to keep information in certain places and controls most of a sites' aesthetics only for sites written in a markup language.
        CSS is most often used for sites written in HTML and XHTML. CSS is mainly used from separating content from presentation.
        CSS was written by W3C which is the main organization responsible for designing World Wide Web.
        The main purpose of CSS was to allow the separation of documents and presentation on a web page. 
        CSS is written to compliment web pages written in markup languages. 
        CSS controls most of the visual aspects and ordering of objects on a web page.
