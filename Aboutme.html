 <h1>Hey Boss!</h1>
  <h2> Who am I? </h2>
   <hi>Hi, my name is Andrew Yee! I am a 10th grader that has joined into the coding class late. 
   I went to Cornerstone Cambridge for middle school before coming to Summit Shasta.
   I have been to China, and a few faraway places in the US, such as Washington D.C. and Oregon. 
   I am also quite fluent in mandarin which is the simplified way of speaking chinese. 
   In Chinese Culture, I am born on the year of the rabbit, which would be 1999 and year 2000 is the year of the dragon.</hi>

  <h2>My favorite food and drink</h2>
  <hi> I love playing video games and working with technology. 
  I enjoy deeply in the act of letting water into my body. 
  I also enjoy seafood since it originates from the ocean. 
  I like water because it is a liquid, and I like seafood because it comes from the ocean, which is also a liquid.
  I like water because of the same reason a runner drinks water after a huge race; it tastes golden. 
  As for seafood, living in an asian household, I get frequently served fish, shrimp, and other seafood like gooey duck.
  I used to drink a lot of soda, so I started to stop drinking soda and primarily drink water. 
  Seafood got turned into a favorite from eating it alot, and then actually enjoying it.</hi>
  <h2>My favorite asian style soup</h2>

  <h2>My hobby</h2>
  <hi>One of my favorite hobbies, is to play video games.
  I used to play the game cube with my older brother when I was a lot younger, and then I loved the idea of these games.
  I like these video games for the challenge they provide, and how I can improve my skill at the game. 
  The favorite parts of video games that I enjoy, are the parts where I can easily tell I have improved at the game. 
  I love the realization that I have gotten better at the game then when I first started playing.</hi>
